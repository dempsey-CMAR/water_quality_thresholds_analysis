# EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS: DISSOLVED OXYGEN CONCENTRATION

August 29, 2023

- Data submitted to the Open Data Portal in December 2022.
- Preliminary QC was applied to the data before submission to the Open Data Portal.
  - Obvious outliers removed.
  - Suspected biofouling removed.
- Additional QC was applied based on review of 0.1_do_mg_per_l_additional_qc.html and 2.1_do_distribution.html.
  - Additional suspected biofouling was removed from the May 2022 deployments.
- Notes on salinity correction:
  - The DO concentration data sent to the Open Data Portal in December 2022 was corrected for salinity using `strings::do_salinity_correction()`.
  - $DO_{corrected} = DO_{raw} * F_s$, where $F_s$ is a salinity correction factor between 0 and 1.
  - The newly processed and flagged data will NOT be corrected for salinity.
  - So to calculate thresholds based on historical data, the correction factor must be removed before analysis.
  - The data presented here is the *uncorrected* dissolved oxygen data.

# Station Locations

Approximate location of stations with dissolved oxygen concentration data.
Marker size is proportional to the number of dissolved oxygen observations within the county.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 7

# join the station locations dataset with the number of obs from each station
st_locations <- st_locations %>% 
  inner_join(
    dat %>% 
      filter(group == "all_station") %>% 
      select(COUNTY = county, STATION = station, n),
    by = c("COUNTY", "STATION") 
  ) %>% 
  group_by(COUNTY) %>% 
  mutate(
    n_prop = round(n / sum(n), digits = 2),
    popup = paste(COUNTY, STATION, n_prop, sep = "</br>")
  ) 

# interactive map
leaflet(st_locations) %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>% 
  add_circle_markers_county(
    county_pal = county_pal, 
    size =  ~n_prop * 25
  ) %>% 
  add_county_fill_legend(county_pal = county_pal)

```

- `r nrow(dat %>% filter(group == "all_station") %>% group_by(county) %>% filter(n() == 1))` counties have only 1 station with dissolved oxygen data: `r x <- dat %>% filter(group == "all_station") %>% group_by(county) %>% filter(n() == 1); paste(x$county, collapse = ", ")`

# Gross Range

```{r}
county <- dat %>% 
  filter(group == "county" | group == "all_data") %>% 
  mutate(
    county = if_else(group == "all_data", "All", county),
    n_percent = round(n * 100 / max(n), digits = 1)
  ) %>% 
  select(-c(year, depth, month, station))

:::

- Most observations are from Lunenburg county.

# Recommendations for Calculating Thresholds

- Pool data together (do not separate by county).
- Thresholds will be based on limited data, so be prepared to modify as new data is collected and processed.
